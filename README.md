# Future of Hospitality Work üì±üè® Research Team Website 

[This website](https://futureofhospitalitywork.github.io/futureofhospitalitywork/), hosted through GitHub Pages, was created to showcase the work of the Future of Hospitality Work research team. 

## Description

Automation is displacing many hospitality workers, largely women and underrepresented groups, with jobs being replaced or transformed by algorithmic management and robotic assistance. Our research team is studying interventions to help workers, employers and technology developers in the hospitality industry to be successful under technological change. We represent researchers from across the fields of human-computer interaction, policy, labor, and hospitality management, partnered together with the largest hospitality labor union in North America, UNITE HERE. 

Together, we focus on creating new ways for hospitality workers to shape how automation will affect their industry and their jobs. Specifically, our team assesses the current state of hospitality services through broad literature reviews, conducting workshops with key stakeholders, collectively exploring technology innovations, and developing a strategic roadmap for future collaboration around automation technologies in the hospitality industry. This project has been funded by the NSF Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier cross-directorate program to promote deeper basic understanding of the interdependent human-technology partnership in work contexts by advancing the design of intelligent work technologies that operate in harmony with human workers.
