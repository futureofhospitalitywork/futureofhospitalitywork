                    <p>Labor shortages have shaped many industries over the past several years, with hospitality
                        experiencing one of the largest rates
                        of attrition. Workers are leaving their jobs for a variety of reasons, ranging from burnout and
                        work intensification, to a lack of
                        meaningful employment. While some literature maintains that labor-replacing automation is poised
                        to bridge the shortages, we argue
                        there is an opportunity for technology design to instead improve job quality and retention.
                        Drawing on interviews with unionized
                        guest room attendants, we report on workers’ perceptions of a widely-used algorithmic room
                        assignment system. We then present
                        worker-generated design ideas that adapt this system toward supporting three key facets of
                        wellbeing: self-efficacy, transparency, and
                        workload. We argue for the need to consider these facets of wellbeing through design across the
                        service landscape, particularly as HCI
                        attends to the impacts of AI and automation on frontline work.</p><br>

                        Examining the Evolution of Frontline Service Work in the Face of Algorithmic Management
                        <span class="years">(2023)</span>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Recent investments in automation and AI are reshaping the hospitality sector. Driven by social
                        and economic forces affecting service delivery, these new technologies have transformed the
                        labor that acts as the backbone to the industry—namely frontline service work performed by
                        housekeepers, front desk staff, line cooks and others. We describe the context for recent
                        technological adoption, with particular emphasis on algorithmic management applications. Through
                        this work, we identify gaps in existing literature and highlight areas in need of further
                        research in the domains of worker-centered technology development. Our analysis highlights how
                        technologies such as algorithmic management shape roles and tasks in the high-touch service
                        sector. We outline how harms produced through automation are often due to a lack of attention to
                        non-management stakeholders. We then describe an opportunity space for researchers and
                        practitioners to elicit worker participation at all stages of technology adoption, and offer
                        methods for centering workers, increasing transparency, and accounting for the context of use
                        through holistic implementation and training strategies.</p><br>
